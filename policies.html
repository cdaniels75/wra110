      <h3>Late Assignments:</h3>
      <p>Late assignments will be lowered one full letter grade for each day past the due date (the first reduction occurs at the start of the class in which the assignment is due).</p>
      <h3>Completion of Assignments: </h3>
      <p>The First-Year Writing Program requires that students produce a significant amount of writing to fulfill their requirement.  You must complete all major assignments to fulfill this requirement and receive a passing grade in First-Year Writing courses.</p>
      <h3>Major Assignments:  </h3>
      <p><strong>The schedule at the end of this syllabus outlines the due dates for major course projects.  Grade distribution for the course is as follows:</strong></p>

      <p>Lived Experiences Project: 10%
      <br />Cultural Analysis Project: 10%
      <br />Formal Research Project: 15%
      <br />Multimodal Remix Project: 20%
      <br />Course Retrospective Project: 15%
      <br />Github Portfolio 15%
      <br />Blog 5%
      <br />Classwork: 10%</p>

<h3>Grading Scale:</h3>

<p>90% - 100% = 4.0
<br />85% - 89.9% = 3.5
<br />80% - 84.9% = 3.0
<br />75% - 79.9% = 2.5
<br />70% - 74.9% = 2.0
<br />65% - 69.9% = 1.5
<br />60% - 64.9% = 1.0
<br />59.9% and below = 0.0</p>

<h3>Academic Honesty:</h3>

<p>Michigan State University has adopted the following statement about academic policy: </p>
<p>GENERAL STUDENT REGULATIONS
<ul><li>1.00 PROTECTION OF SCHOLARSHIP AND GRADES
<br />The principles of truth and honesty are fundamental to the educational process and the academic integrity of the University; therefore, no student shall:
<ul><li>1.01 claim or submit the academic work of another as one’s own.</li>
<li>1.02 procure, provide, accept or use any materials containing questions or answers to any examination or assignment without proper authorization.</li>
<li>1.03 complete or attempt to complete any assignment or examination for another individual without proper authorization.</li>
<li>1.04 allow any examination or assignment to be completed for oneself, in part or in total, by another without proper authorization.</li>
<li>1.05 alter, tamper with, appropriate, destroy or otherwise interfere with the research, resources, or other academic work of another person.</li>
<li>1.06 fabricate or falsify data or results.</li></ul></li></ul>
<p>Procedures for responding to cases of academic honesty and possible repercussions are outlined in Spartan Life: Student Handbook and Resource Guide.  They can also be found on the web at: http://www.msu.edu/unit/ombud/honestylinks.html.  Note: the new procedures require that instances of academic dishonesty be reported through the registrar’s office and forwarded to the Dean of the College in which the student’s major resides.</p>

<h3>University Resources for Writers:</h3>

<p>The Writing Center, the Library, The Learning Resource Center, and the English Language Center all offer support services for writing students.  You should consult these centers’ web sites for information about their specific resources.</p>

<h3>Accommodations for Students with Disabilities:</h3>

<p>Michigan State University is committed to providing equal opportunity for participation in all programs, services and activities. Requests for accommodations by persons with disabilities may be made by contacting the Resource Center for Persons with Disabilities at 517-884- RCPD or on the web at rcpd.msu.edu. Once your eligibility for an accommodation has been determined, you will be issued a verified individual services accommodation ("RISA") form. Please present this form to me at the start of the term and/or two weeks prior to the accommodation date (test, project, etc.). Requests received after this date will be honored whenever possible.</p>
